Apple Share Price Dataset for RNN with LSTM

Dataset Description:

This dataset contains historical stock market data for Apple Inc., spanning 1664 trading days. It is designed for time-series analysis and prediction tasks, such as forecasting stock prices using machine learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units.

Columns:

Date (object): The trading date (format: dd-MMM-yy).
Open (float): Stock price at market open.
High (float): Highest stock price during the trading day.
Low (float): Lowest stock price during the trading day.
Close (float): Stock price at market close.
Volume (int): Total number of shares traded.

Modeling with RNN-LSTM:

Input: Time-series data prepared using sliding windows (e.g., sequences of 30 days to predict the 31st day's Close price).
Output: Predicted stock price or another target feature (e.g., Close).
Features to Include: Start with Close and experiment with additional features (High, Low, Volume) for multivariate analysis.

Dependencies:

Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, tensorflow/keras for RNN-LSTM implementation.
