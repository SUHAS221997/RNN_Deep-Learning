Seattle Weather Dataset for RNN with LSTM

Dataset Overview:

This dataset provides historical daily weather observations in Seattle, spanning 1,461 days. It is ideal for time-series analysis and machine learning projects such as predicting weather conditions using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units.

Data Fields:

date (string): Date of observation in YYYY-MM-DD format.
precipitation (float): Daily precipitation in millimeters (mm).
temp_max (float): Maximum daily temperature in degrees Celsius (°C).
temp_min (float): Minimum daily temperature in degrees Celsius (°C).
wind (float): Daily average wind speed in meters per second (m/s).
weather (string): Description of the weather (e.g., "drizzle," "rain").

Model Implementation (RNN-LSTM):

Input: A sequence of historical weather data (e.g., past 7 days).
Output: Predicted value of a target variable (e.g., temp_max, precipitation).
Features: Include numerical columns and one-hot encoded weather categories.

Dependencies:

This project may require the following Python libraries:

pandas and numpy for data manipulation.
matplotlib for visualization.
tensorflow or keras for RNN-LSTM modeling.
